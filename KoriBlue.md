hi, welcome, this is a thing i'm writing called Kori and Blue. It's about the LGBT+ community, so if any homophobes are viewing this page, please get off.

part 1 

Relationships are a funny thing. You can be best friends with someone and also have a crush on them. Only first of all, you can’t tell them you have a crush and second of all, something called homophobia exists in the case of gay crushes. I mean.. we’re both gay but.. ANYWAYS, my train of thought crashed. So there’s me, Blue, and her, Kori. So anyways, gay crushes aside, there’s gonna be a sleepover today that Kori’s hosting and inviting her friend, Ash. So I text her “can i go to the sleepover”. I saw the text message load, like when the other person’s typing something. 

part 2

… Kori texted yeah. KORI SAID YEAH TO INVITING ME TO THE SLEEPOVER. Maybe (and by maybe I mean “hell nah”) I can tell Kori how I feel about her. I should pack my things and get my parents to drive me there, I’ve spent too long staring at my phone. 

AT THE SLEEPOVER (part 2 section A)

So I got the bunk bed with Ash, and Kori got the spare room. Ash is already sleeping. SNORING. Lightly snoring, so it’s not a HUGE problem. By the way.. I said I wouldn’t do it, but I’ll do it. I’m gonna tell Kori, and let hope she doesn’t hate me for life after this. I knock on Kori’s door. “Blue..?” I can hear faintly. “Yup.” I said and opened the door. It was too dark for anyone to see even a glance of ANYTHING in the room. “Blue. I know what you came in here for.” I doubt.. really? Was it that obvious? “Really?” I ask. “You..” I heard Kori taking a breath, being careful to think of what words to choose, of how to phrase whatever she’s gonna say. “.. have a crush on me. I’m not mad, but I have a crush on.. someone else. Anyways. We’re still friends, don’t worry.” Oh god.. My heart’s now racing. I think I fucked up. “You sure we’re stil-“ “Yeah, I’m sure.” I couldn’t think of anything else to say. SHE couldn’t think of anything else to say. “Night, Blue. “Goodnight, Kori.” I go back to the bunk bed. Ash is STILL asleep, thank god. I lay down. Don’t overthink it. Don’t overthink it. Don’t- I’m overthinking it. Okay, now it’s 11:25PM. 

A FEW HOURS LATER.. (part 2 section B)

I should really go to bed. I should REALLY- It’s just a crush, just… FUCK THESE FEELINGS I’M FEELING. I look at my phone. 2:29AM- and there we go. 2:30AM. I decide I’ll try to sleep, hope everything goes away in the morning. GO AWAY FEELINGS. 

A FEW HOURS LATER (part 2 section C)

Jesus Christ, I don’t usually feel trashy but the fact I slept from 3 to 8 really does shit to ya. So I walk in the kitchen and Ash’s up watching TV. “Blue? You look a bit tired. Did you get any sleep?” “Not really, no.” Ash looked.. a mix of sad and concerned. I suddenly blurted out, “There’s been something keeping me awake most of the night.”

part 3

I sighed as in ‘why’d I have to tell you that?’ “It’s okay, just tell me.” I mentally contemplated, but eventually I said, “Fine.” “So, I have a crush on Kori, let’s get that out of the way.” Ash said, “Go on..” as in ‘let’s just get to the part that’s bothering you.’ “And I told Kori that and she said she had a crush on someone else. That’s what’s been keeping me up.” Ash sighed deeply. “I’m not sure what can help you. Sorry.” “You’re fine, you’re all good.” I said. I then heard Kori yell, “BLUE!” from my room. So, I ran to my room. “Your dad called.” Kori said. I called him back. “Get your stuff ready, we’re picking you up.” “Kay, byeee!” I got ready and stuff, and went back in the car, and of course said bye to Kori and Ash. “Did you have fun at the sleepover?” My mom asked. “Erm.. yeah.” I said. I didn’t wanna tell them about the incident, and I FOR SURE didn’t want to tell them I was a lesbian. They thankfully didn’t ask me to elaborate on my slow, uncertain response. We went home in silence the rest of the time.
